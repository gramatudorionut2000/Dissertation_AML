# Dissertation_AML
This repo contains an implementation of the application part of my dissertation thesis discussing AML in directed multigraphs using autoencoder enhanced graph neural networks.
The work includes two novel architectures of graph neural networks, enhanced with graph neural network components, for the purpose of money laundering detection. These models, as well as baselines are implemented as part of a Django web application

The content included in the fraud_detector\gnn_models has been made available publicly on the following repository of multi-gnn architectures: https://github.com/IBM/Multi-GNN. With the exception of the two autoencoder models developed as part of the thesis, all code belongs to their respective autors.
