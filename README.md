# Dissertation_AML
This repo contains an implementation of the application part of my dissertation thesis discussing AML in directed multigraphs using autoencoder enhanced graph neural networks.

The content included in the fraud_detector\gnn_models has been made available publicly on the following repository of multi-gnn architectures: https://github.com/IBM/Multi-GNN. With the exception of the two autoencoder models developed as part of the thesis, all code belongs to their respective autors.
